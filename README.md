Gender Prediction from Names: Naive Bayes vs. Decision Tree Comparison

This project uses machine learning models (Naive Bayes and Decision Tree) to predict gender (male/female) based on names. The model learns from simple name features like last letter and name length.

ðŸ“Œ Project Overview
Dataset: name_gender_dataset.csv (Contains "Name" and "Gender" columns).

Models Used:

Gaussian Naive Bayes

Decision Tree Classifier

Features:

last_letter: Last character of the name (e.g., "Emma" â†’ "a").

name_length: Length of the name (e.g., "James" â†’ 5).

Performance Metric: Accuracy
